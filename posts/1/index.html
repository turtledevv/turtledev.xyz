hello peoples of the interwebs. sorry i haven't updated the website in a bit.
i've been super busy with stuff recently, and I just haven't had the motivation
to work on pretty much anything. just kinda.. sitting. playing stuff. i'll get to
working on.. something, eventually. and when I do, hopefully it's good?
